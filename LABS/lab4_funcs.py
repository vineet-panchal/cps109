    try solving it again using a different loop style, or a
    different way of producing the first n even integers. Or,

# 7) Maximum of Each Type
# --------------------------------------------------------------      
def maxbytype(items):
    
    '''
    Assume that parameter 'items' is a heterogeneous list that
    may contain integers, floats, strings, and any other type.
    
    You should return a 3-tuple, where the first element is the
    largest integer, the second element is the largest float, 
    and the third element is the largest string.
    
    If any of the types are not found in the list at all, there
    can logically be no maximum, and therefore you should use 
    the value None to represent this.
    
    Example #1) if the input list is:
    [ "hello", 1, 3.14, 99, "cat", "tac", 2.7, "bat" ]
    Then the tuple returned should be: (99, 3.14, "tac")
    
    Example #2) if the input list is: 
    [ "hello", 1, 99, "cat", "tac", "bat" ]
    Then the tuple returned should be: (99, None, "tac")
    
    You can check the type of any object in Python by using the
    type() function. For example, type(item) == float, will 
    return True if item is a float, False otherwise.
    
    FOOD FOR THOUGHT:
    Why might we use the special value 'None' when there is no
    instance of a particular type present in the list? Why not
    use some error value, eg. -1 for integers, or the empty
    string if there is no string?
